# React Programming Project of "Laboratorio de Computacion III"
This is a React integrative programming project where a web page was developed for restaurant customers to book a reservation.

# Description
The web page allows customers to view available time slots and book a reservation for dining at the restaurant. Customers can select the date, time, and party size for the reservation, and then confirm their booking. The page also displays information about the restaurant such as its location, menu, and pricing.
The application was developed using React, for component design and form handling.
